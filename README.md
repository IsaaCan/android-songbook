Guitar Songbook Application for Android

Android SongBook is an application which shows the lyrics of songs with the guitar chords.
While displaying songs the screen is always on, so you can use it while playing on guitar. You can also transpose the song to every different key (using transpose tools such as gestures to left/right or quick menu after clicking on screen).
Also you can turn on the autoscrolling mode, so you can play songs with long lyrics without need to scroll it manually while playing.
Generally, the application tries to help people playing songs on guitar.

To use the Guitar database unzip the songbook DB content (release/SongBook-db-....zip) and put it anywhere on your mobile device.
Next, choose by the SongBook application explorer the selected \*.crd song file, and then enjoy the lyrics with the chords.
