# Guitar Songbook (android-songbook)

Guitar SongBook is a songs lyrics viewer for Android. It highlights guitar chords in lyrics.
While displaying songs the screen is always on, so it can be used while playing on guitar.
It allows you to transpose the chords to every different key (using transposing panel).
Next feature is the autoscrolling mode. It automatically scrolls the lyrics with user-defined speed so there is no need to scroll it manually while playing.

The guitar songs database is included and is easily extensible.
