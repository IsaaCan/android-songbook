Guitar Songbook Application for Android

Android SongBook is an application which shows the lyrics of songs with the coloured guitar chords.
While displaying songs the screen is always on, so it can be used while playing on guitar.
It's also possible to transpose the song to every different key (using transpose tools in quick menu after clicking on screen).
Another feature is the autoscrolling mode. It automatically scrolls the lyrics with user-defined speed so there is no need to scroll it manually while playing.

The guitar songs database is included and is easily extensible by simple file manager.

To use the Guitar database unzip the songbook DB content (release/SongBook-db-....zip) and put it anywhere on your mobile device.
Next, choose by the file explorer (included in SongBook application) some \*.crd song file, and then enjoy the lyrics with the chords.
