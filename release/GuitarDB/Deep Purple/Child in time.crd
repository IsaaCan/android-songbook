Sweet child in time you’ll see the line
The line that’s drawn between the good and the bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying taking toll
If you’ve been bad, lord I bet you have
And you’ve not been hit by flying lead
You’d better close your eyes and bow your head
And wait for the ricochet
