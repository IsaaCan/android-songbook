Sundown dazzling day [g B G# g]
Gold through my eyes [D D7 g g]
But my eyes turned within [B F]
Only see [g]
Starless and bible black [B D D7 c]
[c B A g]
Old friend charity
Cruel twisted smile
And the smile signals emptiness
For me
Starless and bible black

Ice blue silver sky
Fades into grey
To a grey hope that oh yearns to be
Starless and bible black
