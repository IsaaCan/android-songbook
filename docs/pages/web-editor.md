You can Synchronize your songs with a **On-line Web Editor** to modify them in any browser, for instance, on your **desktop computer**.
Then synchronize them back to see the changes on your local device.

Click *3-dots* icon on *My Songs* and pick *Synchronize with Web Editor*.
This will start a temporary session for **24 hours**, which you can access by opening link on any device.

If changes were made in both places (locally and remotely), there might be a **conflict** to be resolved.

*Songbook Web Service* is hosted at [songbook.igrek.dev](https://songbook.igrek.dev/).
Visit it to access your recent sessions.
