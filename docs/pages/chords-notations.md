# Chords Notations

Chords notation is the note naming convention in music.

Songbook supports several chords notations:

- **English**: `Am Bb B C C# Dm Eb`,
- **German (#/b)**: `a B H C C# d Eb`,
- **German (is/es)**: `a B H C Cis d Es`,
- **Dutch**: `Am Bes B C Cis Dm Es`,
- **Japanese**: `Im Hen-ro Ro Ha Ei-ha Nim Hen-ho`,
- **Solfege**: `Lam Sib Si Do Do# Rem Mib`

You can pick your favourite chords notation in the Settings.

Default chords notation had already been set automatically depending on your system language
(Some chords notations are used only in particular countries).

!!! note
    Name `B` in music can denote completely different notes depending on the chords notation.
    According to **English** notation `B` is the note being 1 semitone lower than `C`,
    while according to **German** notation it's the sound that is 2 semitones lower than `C` (so it's English `Bb`).
    Thus, it's extremely important to select the appropriate **chords notation** before interpreting chords.

!!! note
    **German** chords notation changes note names to lowercase in case of a minor chord,
    eg. `d` (instead of English `Dm`).
    Songbook takes that into account too.
