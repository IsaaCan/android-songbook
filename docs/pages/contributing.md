Songbook allows you to **publish** your own songs and **share** them with others.

## How to publish a song?
Create a custom song in **My songs** panel.

Click :material-dots-vertical: button and select **Publish** option to send your song.

Your song will be reviewed against [Chord Format Specification](./chord-format.md)
so make sure it adheres to the formatting principles.
If everything's fine, expect your song to appear in the **Latest songs** in the next database update.

## Revision of the song
You can also suggest an improvement of some chords or lyrics,
if you have noticed some errors in a song.

Do it by clicking :material-dots-vertical: button next to a song,
choose **Make editable copy**. Revise the errors in a song and publish it.

## Missing song?
If you didn't find your favourite song in a database
or you feel that some song is missing,
you can use **Missing song** option to request a song
and propose filling the gaps in the database.

!!! note
    You can also add the missing song on your own to **My songs**.
    Then use the **Publish** option to fill the gaps in the database.
    We encourage you to do so.
