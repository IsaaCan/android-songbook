Songbook allows you to publish your custom songs and share it along the other people.

## How to publish a song?
Create a custom song in "My songs" panel.

Click :material-dots-vertical: button and select "Publish" option to send your song.

Your song will be reviewed against [Chord Format Specification](./chord-format.md)
so make sure it adheres to the formatting principles.
If everything's fine, expect your song to appear in the "Latest" songs in the next database update.

## Revision of the song
You can also suggest an improvement of some chords or lyrics,
if you have noticed some errors in a song.

Do it by clicking :material-dots-vertical: button next to a song,
choose "make editable copy". Revise the errors in a song and publish it.
