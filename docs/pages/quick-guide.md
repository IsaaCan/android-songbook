## Autoscroll

Click autoscroll icon on top action bar to show autoscroll panel.
Starting autoscroll causes the lyrics to be scrolled automatically by the timer.

There is an moving eye-focus zone prompting where to look when playing.
The progress of Autoscroll is indicated by the eye-focus zone (highlighted moving bar on the right).

To apply the initial delay, the autoscroll waits until the eye-focus zone enters the middle of the screen.
Then, it starts scrolling the song until the end of song is reached.
Also, there is a count-down timer displayed before scrolling at the beginning of the song.

You can interrupt the initial countdown (initial delay) by scrolling down manually.
Then the scroll will be started immediately.
However, if you scroll up manually while in countdown,
the initial delay will be increased to give you more time.

If the scrolling is too fast or too slow,
you can adjust the speed in settings or in autoscroll panel.
However, it gets adjusted automatically, if you scroll up or down manually,
while the autoscrolling is enabled.
Then, it causes autoscroll speed to be auto-adjusted accordingly (speed up or slow down),
so it learns your style.

Double click on screen to toggle autoscrolling. Clicking once again will turn it off.

See more about [Autoscroll](./autoscroll.md).
