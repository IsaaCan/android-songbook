You can transpose the chords of any song to **any key**.

![](./assets/res-drawable/transpose.png){ style="background: #1564C0; height: 1.5em; vertical-align: top;" }
on top action bar to show the transposing panel.

!!! tip "Did you know?"
    *Songbook* **automatically** recognizes **the key** of the song based on the chords it is composed of

## Autoscroll
[![](./assets/screenshots-mobile-en/03.png){ width="250" }](./assets/screenshots-mobile-en/03.png)

Click **Autoscroll** icon
![](./assets/res-drawable/scroll1.png){ style="background: #1564C0; height: 1.5em; vertical-align: top;" }
on top action bar to show autoscroll panel.
Starting autoscroll causes the lyrics to be scrolled automatically by the timer.

There is an moving **eye-focus zone** prompting where to look when playing.
The progress of Autoscroll is indicated by the eye-focus zone (highlighted moving bar on the right).

To apply the **initial delay**, the autoscroll waits until the eye-focus zone enters the middle of the screen.
Then, it starts scrolling the song until the end of song is reached.
Also, there is a count-down timer displayed before scrolling at the beginning of the song.

You can interrupt the **initial delay** (initial countdown) by scrolling down manually.
Then the scroll will be started immediately.
On the other hand, if you scroll up manually while in countdown,
the initial delay will be increased to give you more time.

If the scrolling is too fast or too slow,
you can adjust the **scroll speed** in the **Settings** or in autoscroll panel.
However, it gets adjusted automatically, if you scroll up or down manually,
while the autoscrolling is on.
Then, it causes autoscroll speed to be **auto-adjusted** accordingly (speed up or slow down),
so it learns your style.

!!! tip
    Double click on screen to toggle autoscrolling.
    Clicking once again will turn it off.
