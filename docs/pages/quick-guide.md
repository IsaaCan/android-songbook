# Quick User Guide
Here are some tips and features of Songbook which you may not know about.

## Song Selection
You can choose a song from the **Artists** view,
**Top songs**, **Latest songs** list or **Search** panel.

**Search** panel without any phrase shows the list of **all** songs in alphabetical order.

!!! tip
    You can search a song by **title**, **artist** or even by a **fragment of the lyrics**.
    Search by any word, uppercase / lowercase doesn't matter.

## Song Preview

Songbook displays the **lyrics** of the song with highlighted **chords**.
On a song preview it keeps the display always on.

Pinch with two fingers to change the font size.

In settings, you can pick your favourite [**Chords Displaying Style**](./displaying-styles.md)
and the [**Chords Notation**](./chords-notations.md).
Default chords notation had already been set automatically depending on your system language
(based on the fact that some chords notations are used in particular countries).

## Transposing

You can transpose the chords from any song to any **key**.
Click transposing icon on top action bar to show transposing panel.

- Click `-5`, `-1`, `+1`, `+5` buttons to transpose by particular number of semitones.
- Click `0` button to restore the original key.

Songbook recognizes the **key** of the song based on the chords it is composed of
and displays it in the Transposing panel.
It shows the detected **Major key** along with its **minor key** counterpart, eg. `C / Am`.

## Autoscroll

Click **Autoscroll** icon on top action bar to show autoscroll panel.
Starting autoscroll causes the lyrics to be scrolled automatically by the timer.

There is an moving **eye-focus zone** prompting where to look when playing.
The progress of Autoscroll is indicated by the eye-focus zone (highlighted moving bar on the right).

To apply the **initial delay**, the autoscroll waits until the eye-focus zone enters the middle of the screen.
Then, it starts scrolling the song until the end of song is reached.
Also, there is a count-down timer displayed before scrolling at the beginning of the song.

You can interrupt the **initial delay** (initial countdown) by scrolling down manually.
Then the scroll will be started immediately.
On the other hand, if you scroll up manually while in countdown,
the initial delay will be increased to give you more time.

If the scrolling is too fast or too slow,
you can adjust the **scroll speed** in settings or in autoscroll panel.
However, it gets adjusted automatically, if you scroll up or down manually,
while the autoscrolling is on.
Then, it causes autoscroll speed to be **auto-adjusted** accordingly (speed up or slow down),
so it learns your style.

!!! tip
    Double click on screen to toggle autoscrolling.
    Clicking once again will turn it off.
