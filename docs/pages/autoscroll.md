# Autoscroll

Songbook can scroll the song automatically while playing.
This feature is called "Autoscroll".

Click autoscroll icon on top action bar to show autoscroll panel.
Starting autoscroll causes the lyrics to be scrolled automatically by the timer.

If lyrics are at the beginning, autoscrolling will be started with some delay (counting down before scrolling).
If you scroll down manually while this countdown, the scroll will be started immediately.
However, if you scroll up manually while countdown, the initial delay will be increased.

You can adjust scrolling speed or initial delay of autoscroll in settings or in autoscroll panel.
Scrolling up or down manually, while autoscrolling is enabled, causes autoscroll speed to be auto-adjusted (speed up or slow down accordingly).

Double click on screen to toggle autoscrolling. Clicking once again will turn it off.
