# Song Cast

**Song Cast** is a *Songbook*'s protocol to display songs on many devices.
Create a room so that your friends could join it.
Once the presenter chooses a song, it will be broadcasted and displayed on all devices connected to a room.

**Song Cast** shares and displays songs on many devices over Internet connection.

Share the code with others so they can join this room as *Spectators*.
As a presenter you can control the song's scroll on all devices by either sharing scroll position or enabling **Slides mode**
(click **Song Cast** icon in a song preview).
**Slides mode** presents only selected lines of the song and animates them on Spectator's device.
